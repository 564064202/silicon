# How to contribute


The framework could evolve in many ways. However, since the project is
not yet funded, my time dedicated to Silicon is limited to only few
days per month so features are added at a pretty slow speed.  If you
find this project useful, you are welcome to contribute.  The core of
the framework is now complete but there is room for new middlewares and
new backends.

New middlewares could be access to external webservices, database
drivers, logging, oauth, ... You can read more about middlewares [here](/docs/middlewares.html).

New backends are also welcome. They could add support for other protocols like
HTTP/2, bluetooth, UDP, ... There is a small introduction to backends [here](/docs/backends.html)

If you cannot contribute to the project but still want to help, [you
can donate to the project
here](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/28272). I would like to give
special thanks to our first donnor [Matthew Frost](http://www.matthewfrost.com/).
